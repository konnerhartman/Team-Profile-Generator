# Team Profile Generator
  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)
  
  ## Description
  This app allows the user to develop a team profile page with three options of employees (manager, engineer, and intern). It was built using OOP (object orrianted programming) and Node.JS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My motivation to build this app was to allow the user to quickly and easily create a team page of all their employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I build this app to gain knowledge, experience, and practice with back-end web development using OOP and Node.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This app solves the problem of having to build an entire teams page from scratch. An empolyeer can simple answer questions from a prompt and have their team page generated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While building this app I learned about OOP, NPM Tests, and Node.JS
